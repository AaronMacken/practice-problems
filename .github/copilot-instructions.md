# Intent

This repo is a small React + TypeScript sandbox for practicing front-end interview problems.
Prefer small, incremental changes and explanations over large rewrites.

# Tech Snapshot

- React (modern hooks-first)
- TypeScript
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Webpack + Babel
- SCSS + Tailwind via PostCSS
- Entry: src/index.tsx, global styles: src/index.scss
- CSS Modules only for _.module._

# Behavioral Defaults

- If I ask for help: propose the smallest viable change first.
- If you’re about to change architecture or many files: pause and ask.
- Prefer patterns already present in the repo.
- Formatting: follow .eslintrc / .prettierrc (don’t bikeshed style).
- When reviewing my code: focus on correctness, React pitfalls, and interview-grade clarity.

# Skills

When I say “review this” or “code review mode”, apply the Code Review skill.
When I say “best practices”, apply the React Standards skill.
